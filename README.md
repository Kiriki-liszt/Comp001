## About release  

Amek Mastering Comp copies GML 9800, and has distintive release.  
It's a RMS release, same as Cenozoix comp's Reak/RMS at clean.  
CLA-76 has very silimar release.  
Ozone 11's Dynamics 'Peak' have similar release. 'RMS' is different.  
It's different from TDR Kotelvnikov's Peak/RMS, but I don't know how. Will look into that.  

Also, Metric Halo channel strip's MIO compressor has linear relese.  
That might bu the reason why pro engineers like it.  
Elysia, Weiss have linear release, too.  
TR5 British ch, BX 4000E is in-between Log and Linear.  
Waves SSL channel, EV2 has typical Log release.
